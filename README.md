# Solving Problems with Numerical Methods ‚Äì R Code Repository

This repository contains R code and resources related to the course **"Solving Problems with Numerical Methods"** by Janani Ravi. The course provides a comprehensive introduction to the conceptual understanding and practical implementation of numerical techniques for solving mathematical problems that are difficult or impossible to solve analytically.

## üìö Course Overview

Many real-world problems (such as weather prediction, spacecraft trajectory, and real-time pricing) are too complex for symbolic solutions but can be tackled using numerical methods. This course teaches a wide variety of numerical techniques and their applications using the R programming language.

### Modules Covered

#### Understanding Numerical Methods
- Differences between numerical and analytical methods
- Importance of numerical procedures

#### Applying Numerical Methods to Solve Problems
- Direct and iterative techniques for solving systems of linear equations
- Interpolation and extrapolation methods

#### Working with Graphs Using Numerical Techniques
- Graph representation in R
- Real-world applications of graph algorithms

#### Implementing Local Search and Optimizations
- Local search techniques for problems like N-queens
- Stochastic local search, simulated annealing, and threshold accepting algorithms

#### Implementing Integration and Differentiation
- Numerical differentiation and integration using R
